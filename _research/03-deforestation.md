title: "Deforestation"

I am working on a project that analyzes the role that financial secrecy plays in enabling environmental harm by tracing the supply chains of commodities linked to deforestation.

Another project examines the political economy of illegal logging and estimates the amount of corruption in the forestry sector through wood laundering.
