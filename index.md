I am a PhD candidate at the Bren School of Environment Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am a political economist and an applied statistician.

My research focuses on deforestation, climate change, and illicit economies. I use quasi-experimental techniques from econometrics and methods from statistical data science such as machine learning to answer questions about pressing environmental problems. Another strand of my research agenda focuses on finding evidence of illicit activity: behavior which, by definition, seeks to remain hidden.

Prior to joining the Bren School, I was a researcher at the [Center for Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/) for 3 years. I have also worked for the African Secretariat of [ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability](https://africa.iclei.org/) in Cape Town.

I have consulted for organizations such as the [United Nations Economic Commission for Africa](https://www.uneca.org/), the [Tax Justice Network](https://www.taxjustice.net/), and the [Business & Sustainable Development Commission](http://businesscommission.org/).

I have an MA in [Statistics](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB. I also hold an MSc in [Economic History](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Economic-History) from the London School of Economics, and an MSc in Economics and Public Policy from [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/en.html) and [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). My Bachelors was in [European Social and Political Studies](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/european-international-social-political-studies/) from University College London.

I am affiliated with the [ENVENT](https://www.enventlab.com/) and the [Conservation Economics](http://conservation-econ.com/) labs at UCSB.
