I study the commodification of the natural environment. How does the international financial system enable environmental degradation? I analyze the role of financial secrecy and global commodity supply chains in driving environmental harm. Can we harness those same market forces to produce innovative policy solutions to environmental problems? I evaluate the efficacy of market-driven governance schemes and derive lessons for the design of environmental policies.

My work has three broad applications.
