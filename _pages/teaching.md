## Introduction to Research Methods in Political Science

I was the instructor of record for this class during Summer 2020 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The course exposes undergraduate students to quantitative research in political science. It introduces them to probability, statistical inference, and regression analysis. Students are trained to code in R. Emphasis is placed on thinking critically about the nature of causality in the social sciences. [Syllabus](/assets/M20-POLS-15-Syllabus.pdf){: .btn .btn--document}

The course was delivered remotely using a mix of synchronous and asynchronous delivery. See below for some selected slides and video lectures:
